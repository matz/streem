Streem is a concurrent scripting language based on a programming model
similar to shell, with influences from Ruby, Erlang and other
functional programming languages.

In Streem, a simple `cat` program looks like this:

```
STDIN | STDOUT
```

Streem is a (sort of) DSL for data flows.  Above code means
building data-flow connection between `STDIN` and `STDOUT`.
Actual data processing will be done in the event loop
invoked after program execution.

For another example, a simple FizzBuzz will look like this:

```
seq(100) | {|x|
  if x % 15 == 0 {
    "FizzBuzz"
  }
  else if x % 3 == 0 {
    "Fizz"
  }
  else if x % 5 == 0 {
    "Buzz"
  }
  else {
    x
  }
} | STDOUT
```

The second part in the pipeline (`{|x|...}`) is a function
object.  If a function object is connected in the pipeline,
it will be invoked for each elements in the stream.

# Note

Streem is still in the design stage. It's not working yet.  Stay tuned.

# How to test

## Cram

[Cram](https://bitheap.org/cram/) is a testing framework for testing command line applications.

Cram tests look like snippets of interactive shell sessions. Cram runs each command and compares the command output in the test with the command's actual output.

## Install Cram Testing Framework

```
$ sudo pip install cram
```

## Running tests

```
$ cram tests/*.t -E
```
