Streem is a stream based concurrent scripting language. It is based on a
programming model similar to the shell, with influences from Ruby, Erlang, and
other functional programming languages.

__Note:__ Streem is still in the design stage. It's not working yet.  Stay tuned.

## Examples
In Streem, a simple `cat` program looks like this:

```
STDIN | STDOUT
```

Streem is a (sort of) DSL for data flows.  Above code means
building data-flow connection between `STDIN` and `STDOUT`.
Actual data processing will be done in the event loop
invoked after program execution.

For another example, a simple FizzBuzz will look like this:

```
seq(100) | {x ->
  if x % 15 == 0 {
    "FizzBuzz"
  }
  else if x % 3 == 0 {
    "Fizz"
  }
  else if x % 5 == 0 {
    "Buzz"
  }
  else {
    x
  }
} | STDOUT
```

The second part in the pipeline (`{x ->...}`) is a function
object.  If a function object is connected in the pipeline,
it will be invoked for each element in the stream.

## Compiling

### Installing dependencies

* bison
* flex
* gcc / clang
* libgc (libgc-dev on Debian/Ubuntu, bdw-gc on OSX homebrew)

### Run make
```
make
```

Please note that Streem will not run any scripts yet, but you can check parse files and check syntax.
