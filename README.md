# Streem - stream based concurrent scripting language

Streem is a concurrent scripting language based on a programming model
similar to shell, with influences from Ruby, Erlang and other
functional programming languages.

In Streem, a simple `cat` program looks like this:

```
STDIN | STDOUT
```

And a simple FizzBuzz will look like this:

```
seq(100) | {|x|
  if x % 15 == 0 {
    "FizzBuzz"
  }
  else if x % 3 == 0 {
    "Fizz"
  }
  else if x % 5 == 0 {
    "Buzz"
  }
  else {
    x
  }
} | STDOUT
```

# Note

Streem is still in the design stage. It's not working yet.  Stay tuned.
